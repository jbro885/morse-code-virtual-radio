- Gain experience in multithreaded programming

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

- [Apply abstraction and decomposition to solve more complex problems](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/developer)
- [Combine inputs and/or outputs to create projects or solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/builder)
- [Use manufacturing techniques and tools to create prototype projects](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/manufacture/builder)
