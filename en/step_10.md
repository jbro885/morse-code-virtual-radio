## Play a listening game with a friend

Now that you have a way to verify the correctness of your keying, you can play a listening game with a friend.

The other person should:

- Have a printout of the Morse Code tree
- Some paper, a pencil, and an eraser
- Be able to hear your Morse tones
- Not be able to see your screen

The aim of the game is to key in a message and see if the other person can decode it using just their ears. This is how it was done during both World Wars. It's trickier than it sounds so go slowly and start off with just letters, then progress onto words and messages. The other person should write down on some paper what they think is being keyed in; when the message is finished you can compare what they wrote down to what was shown on the screen.

Try not to write dots and dashes; instead try to get into the zone of listening to the tones, following the tree and arriving at a letter. Record the letters instead of the code. If the message sounds like gibberish when you're decoding just keep going; the person behind the screen could be making mistakes. The aim is for you to have exactly what is shown on their screen, even if it's wrong.
